Idea:- C.U.E. (Click Upload Earn) is stock photography and stock footage app that bridges the gap between companies/brands and photographers and videographers. Contributors get a platform to highlight their work and brands looking for media and content for advertising get a single stop for finding the apt content along with a merchandising option embedded for them as well. Companies can reach out to our crowd to request media that they can use for advertisement purposes. Users from the crowd will upload the media content on our app and our moderators will filter the top 10, top 50 and top 100 uploads that suit the company’s request best and provide them to the company. If the company likes the content being provided, it will reach out to the creator and buy his/her content and we can even deliver merchandise with the pic they like on it. Images and videos will be classified by our content team so that companies find it easier to find specific videographers and photographers of their choice.
